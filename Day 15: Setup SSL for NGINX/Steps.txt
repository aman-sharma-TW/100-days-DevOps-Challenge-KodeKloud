Hereâ€™s how to prepare App Server 2 for the application deployment using Nginx with SSL as per the given requirements.

1. Install and configure Nginx
* Login to App Server 2 (from the Jump Host):

sudo chmod 600 /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.*

3. Configure Nginx for SSL
* Modify you nginx.conf file as per the file in the repo (nginx.conf)
* Then test the nginx configuration:
sudo nginx -t

* If all is OK, reload nginx:

4. Create index.html
echo "Welcome!" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html

5. Test from Jump Host

curl -Ik https://<App-Server-2-IP>

Final Checklist:
 1. Nginx installed and running on App Server 2
 2. SSL certificate and key moved and configured
 3. HTTPS server block set up in nginx
 4. index.html with Welcome! created
 5. Curl from Jump Host returns 200 OK over HTTPS
